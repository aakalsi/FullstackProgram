What does it do?

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used to inform a website visitor's browser that the document being rendered is an HTML document. While not actually an HTML element itself, every HTML document should being with a DOCTYPE declaration to be compliant with HTML standards.

Declaring a DOCTYPE

All HTML need to have a DOCTYPE declared. The DOCTYPE is not actually an element or HTML tag. It lets the browser know how the document should be interpreted, by indicating what version or standard of HTML (or other markup language) is being used.

HTML5 Documents

For HTML5 documents (which nearly all new web documents should be), the DOCTYPE declaration should be:

<!DOCTYPE html>
This needs to be the first thing in your document, before the <html> or <head> elements. Also, there is no closing tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
*
*
*
</head>
<body>
*
*
*
</body>
</html>

In the dark ages of the internet, before the web standards, there we two huge browsers: Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. And web pages were usually developed separately for each of them.

After the creation of the standards, browsers introduced two ways of rendering, one for standards compliant websites and quirks mode to support the legacy sites.

So when you specify the doctype in the beginning of your document - you tell the browser that the webpage should be rendered in standards mode.

Otherwise if you omit it - you make the browser to use the quirks mode.

Before html5, there were several others that had more complex syntax. You had to specify the link to the actual doctype declaration. For example like in this html4.01 strict. We specify the link to the doctype on w3.org website

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
